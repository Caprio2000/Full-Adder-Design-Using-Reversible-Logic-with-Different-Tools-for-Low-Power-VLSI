# Full-Adder-Design-Using-Reversible-Logic-with-Different-Tools-for-Low-Power-VLSI
In this work we propose a study to the logic design synthesis of different circuit by using reversible computing.  This study is based on the use of full adder circuit using reversible logic synthesis. The idea is designing an adder circuit  with low power dissipation and low power consumption. Among the properties of reversible gate, we have a minimum  of input constant number of gate and number of garbage output. Garbage output are those output which is not using  for any consumption. Full adder cell is one of the most frequently used digital circuit component in arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and  it is the essential functional unit of all computational circuit. Till now lots of improvement has been done in this area  to refine the architecture and performance of full adder circuit design. In this project, designs of novel full adder cell  at 90nm CMOS technology are implemented by using CMOS transistors along with the existing full adder cell using  reversible computing.
